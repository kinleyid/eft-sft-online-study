<h3>Purpose of the Study:</h3>
The purpose of this study is to investigate how people imagine the future and make decisions. 

<h3>Procedures involved in the Research:</h3>
<h4>Informed consent:</h4>
After reading this consent form, if you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to click on “PROCEED TO BEGIN STUDY” and you will be taken to the main part of the study and this will be taken as your indication of your consent. If you would like to receive a summary of the results, there is also an option to include your email.
<h4>Experimental protocol:</h4>
This experiment takes roughly 30 minutes to complete. You will be seated in front of a computer screen and will be asked to complete two monetary choice tasks, a future imagination task, and a questionnaire. The monetary choice tasks will take around 2 minutes to complete, the future imagination task will take about 10 minutes, and the questionnaire will take about 10 minutes.

<h3>Potential Harms, Risks or Discomforts:</h3>
The risks involved in taking part in this study are minimal. The procedures and questionnaires that we use in our experiments are those traditionally used in this type of research. It is possible that the questions on how well you attended to the task may make you uncomfortable. Please note that you do not need to answer any questions that make you uncomfortable or that you do not wish to answer.</br>
</br>
You may worry that someone else could see your responses to questions about how well you attended to the task. Your data will be assigned a numeric participant code, thus all your responses will be completely anonymous. Your IP address will not be attached to your data and will not be saved. Thus, there will be no way for anyone, not even a member of the research team, to link any of your test results to your IP address or any other personal information.</br>
</br>
You may worry that you will not be reimbursed based on your answers about how well you attended to the task. There will be no penalty on the basis of these answers and all participants will receive SONA credit for participating.

<h3>Potential Benefits:</h3>
The research will not benefit you directly.  However, it will provide insight on the way people imagine the future and make decisions. The results from this study may inform further scientific investigations and may help individuals to make better lifestyle choices.

<h3>Payment or Reimbursement:</h3>
You will receive course credit (if eligible), as outlined in the Introductory Psychology Handbook, for participating in this experiment. You will receive 0.5 credits for completing this study.

<h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
We will not collect any information from you that could identify you personally. Only your participant ID and not your IP address will be attached to your data. The experimenter and the individual(s) assisting in running this experiment will not know which data were collected from you. However, you have the option of providing your email address in this form if you wish to be contacted about the results of this study.

<h3>Participation and Withdrawal:</h3>
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You can decide to stop participating at any time.  If you decide to withdraw from the experiment, which you may do at any time, you will still be compensated for your time. At the end of the study, you will be given the choice to select from the options: “submit my data” or “discard my data, I wish to withdraw.” If you do not select either option we will not be able to provide your compensation, so please be sure to select one or the other option.</br>
</br>
Unless you request to have your data discarded, if possible, we will retain and use any partially completed data collected from you up to the point that you withdraw from the study. Data may only be removed until the end of the experiment session as there will be no way to remove anonymous data once it has been added to the dataset.</br>
</br>
<h3>Information about the Study Results: </h3>
The first wave of data collection for this study will be completed by September 1, 2019. If you would like a brief summary of the results, please indicate this at the bottom of this consent form by providing an email address to which we can send the results.</br>
